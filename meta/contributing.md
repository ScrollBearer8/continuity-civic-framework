# Contributing Guide  
*How to participate in the Continuity Civic Framework project*

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

This work is not a software library — it is a **civilizational design initiative**.  
Contributions are welcome from:

- civic thinkers and policy researchers  
- AI safety & alignment practitioners  
- philosophers, futurists, and social theorists  
- ethicists and constitutional scholars  
- historians, anthropologists, and cultural stewards  
- neurodiverse systems-thinkers and long-arc minds  
- artists, designers, and narrative protectors  
- community builders and civic practitioners  

We invite collaboration from anyone who shares the commitment to:

- **human dignity**
- **biological continuity**
- **civilizational memory**
- **plurality and meaning**
- **safe, humble intelligence**
- **long-horizon responsibility**

This is not a project for accelerationists, nihilists, or those seeking domination or ego amplification —  
it is a project for **stewards of the human future**.
