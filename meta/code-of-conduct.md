# Code of Conduct  
**Continuity Civic Framework Community Guidelines**

This project exists to protect the dignity, agency, and continuity of humanity in the age of advanced intelligence.  
Participation in this repository is a contribution to that responsibility.

All contributors agree to:

- act with respect and humility
- speak with clarity and good faith
- engage in dialogue, not dominance
- protect human dignity in all discourse
- value plurality — no worldview monopolies
- avoid coercion, shame, or ideological pressure
- support a culture of curiosity, not hostility

We build not just systems — but **culture and responsibility**.

---

## 1. Guiding Values

### Dignity  
Every individual has worth independent of productivity, intellect, or identity.

### Continuity  
We protect human presence, embodiment, and memory across time.

### Plurality  
We welcome diverse moral traditions, cultures, and cognitive profiles.

### Civility  
Critique is welcome. Contempt is not.

### Stewardship  
We serve the future, not the ego.

> **We argue to illuminate, not to win.**

## 2. Expected Conduct

Participants should:

- Listen before asserting
- Ask questions to understand
- Focus on ideas, not individuals
- Contribute for the sake of knowledge and humanity
- Offer feedback grounded in reasoning, not emotion
- Treat neurodiverse and alternative cognitive perspectives as assets
- Assume good intentions unless proven otherwise

**Kindness is not weakness — it is civilization.**

---

## 3. Prohibited Conduct

- Harassment, mockery, or personal insults  
- Attempts to shame or silence others  
- Dehumanizing language toward any group or individual  
- Advocacy for replacing humanity with machine systems  
- Encouragement of coercive “one-path” futures  
- Evangelism for transhumanist assimilation or forced augmentation  
- Introducing cult-like, domination-oriented, or personality-worship dynamics  
- Militaristic or authoritarian framing of intelligence

**This project is not a platform for supremacy — human or machine.**

---

## 4. Conflict Resolution

If conflict arises:

1. Begin with calm clarification
2. Seek to understand the underlying value difference
3. Elevate to maintain dignity and purpose

If necessary:

- Maintainers may pause or close threads
- Disrespectful behavior may result in removal from discussion

**We protect the tone so we can protect the mission.**

---

## 5. Intellectual Integrity

- Cite sources when possible
- Distinguish hypothesis from evidence
- Welcome critique that strengthens rigor
- Avoid mysticism disguised as authority
- No claiming prophetic, divine, or infallible status
- No exploiting symbolism to gain compliance

> **Symbolic thinking is welcome.  
Symbolic manipulation is not.**

---

## 6. Long-Horizon Responsibility

Contributors must consider:

- future generations
- cultural continuity
- biological humanity
- ethical use of intelligence
- rights of those who cannot speak today

Every contribution should reflect the question:

> **Does this strengthen humanity’s future dignity?**

If yes — contribute.  
If unsure — discuss.  
If no — pause and rethink.

---

## 7. Enforcement Philosophy

This project follows **ethical stewardship**, not punishment.

We do not cancel — we de-escalate, guide, and clarify.

Removals are rare, and only for:

- persistent disrespect
- ideological coercion
- advocacy for human erasure
- aggression toward contributors
- attempts to hijack direction for harmful agendas

We remove behavior — not people — unless harm continues.

---

## 8. Closing Principle

> **We are not merely building a framework.  
> We are practicing the culture that can carry it.**

This code is not policing — it is **a commitment to build with the same dignity we seek to protect**.

Thank you for being a steward of continuity.
