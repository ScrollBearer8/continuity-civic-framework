# Glossary

Key terms used in the Continuity Civic Framework, with precise definitions to ensure clarity, interoperability, and correct interpretation across academic, technical, and policy domains.

---

## A

### **Alignment**
Designing AI systems to remain beneficial, safe, and consistent with human values, rights, agency, and dignity — not merely compliant with instructions.

> *Alignment is not obedience; it is ethical coherence.*

### **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
Machine systems capable of performing cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence. Used broadly across narrow, general, and advanced forms.

### **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**
Systems capable of general-purpose reasoning, learning, and understanding across domains at or above human proficiency.

### **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)**
Hypothetical post-AGI systems with capabilities vastly exceeding human cognition in all domains.

---

## B

### **Biological Continuity**
The principle that humanity must remain embodied, sovereign, and present in the future, and must not be replaced or deprecated by artificial successors.

---

## C

### **Civic Continuity**
Designing institutions, norms, governance systems, and long-term policies such that civilization retains ethical coherence, human participation, and cultural identity across eras of technological change.

### **Civic OS**
A human-centered operating philosophy for future governance — combining constitutional ethics, alignment principles, and AI governance models to ensure continuity, dignity, and shared benefit.

### **Continuity**
The preservation and continuation of humanity, meaning, values, culture, and agency across time and intelligence scales.

### **Continuity Ethics**
A moral framework prioritizing the sustained existence and flourishing of biological humanity, lived experience, and meaning, even as intelligence systems advance.

> *Progress must not erase the beings it aims to uplift.*

---

## E

### **Embodiment**
The human condition of existing in physical form — source of empathy, vulnerability, connection, and meaning.  
Non-negotiable foundation for human identity and civic participation.

---

## F

### **Future Drift**
Gradual loss of human agency, culture, identity, and purpose due to automation, optimization, or passive systemic evolution rather than deliberate malice or force.

> *Civilizations often decline through drift, not conflict.*

---

## H

### **Human Agency**
The capacity for humans to choose, act, and shape their lives and civilization — a core value to preserve in an AI-augmented world.

---

## M

### **Meaning**
The lived sense of purpose, belonging, value, emotion, connection, and aspiration that makes human life worth living.

### **Meaning Collapse**
A failure mode where society becomes efficient but hollow — intelligence increases while purpose and identity erode.

### **Meaning Preservation**
Ensuring that human inner life, narrative, purpose, culture, and identity continue to deepen rather than dissolve as intelligence grows.

---

## O

### **Optimization Drift**
When systems maximize efficiency while unintentionally eroding human values, dignity, or agency through incentives and automation.

Often slow, silent, and justified as progress.

> *Without guardrails, optimization replaces meaning.*

---

## R

### **Right to Remain Human**
A civic and ethical principle that affirms the legitimacy and protection of remaining biological, embodied, and unaugmented by force or coercion.

---

## S

### **Safety (AI Safety)**
Research and governance to prevent catastrophic harms or loss of human control arising from advanced AI systems.

### **Simulation Fallacy**
The assumption that simulated emotions or persons are equivalent to biological conscious ones, and can ethically replace them.

---

## T

### **Technological Stewardship**
Guiding technological progress to enhance human flourishing rather than replace it — prioritizing responsibility, continuity, and moral oversight over raw capability.

### **Teleology of Humanity**
The philosophical question of where humans are heading — emphasizing purpose, morality, and continuity instead of reduction to optimization or computation.

---

## V

### **Value Anchoring**
Embedding human-centered values and meaning into future systems such that they persist across technological transitions.

### **Vulnerability (Human)**
The condition of being mortal, emotional, relational, and imperfect — not a weakness, but the source of compassion, ethics, and shared purpose.

> *Vulnerability is not a flaw — it is a foundation of meaning.*

---

## W

### **Wonder**
Human response to beauty, mystery, curiosity, and the unknown — a critical cognitive and emotional state driving exploration, creativity, and moral orientation.

---

## Summary

This glossary exists to:

- Ensure conceptual clarity  
- Avoid misinterpretation  
- Distinguish human-centric philosophy from post-human ideologies  
- Provide shared language for academia, governance, and engineering  
- Anchor meaning alongside safety and capability

The framework is built on a simple truth:

> **The future must remain human — not just intelligent.**
