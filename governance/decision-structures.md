# Decision Structures  
**Human–AI Co-Decision Frameworks for the Continuity Era**

## Purpose
Define how humans and AI systems make decisions together in a way that:

- Preserves human sovereignty
- Uses AI for clarity, foresight, and rigor
- Prevents automated governance
- Ensures accountability and meaning remain human-led
- Avoids “silent takeover via convenience or automation”

> AI assists.  
> Humans decide.  
> Continuity binds them.

## Co-Decision Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
Human Primacy | Humans retain final authority in consequential domains |
AI as Augmentation | AI expands deliberation, foresight, and insight |
Meaning-Safety | Decisions preserve human meaning, dignity, and continuity |
Transparency | AI recommendations must be explainable |
Multi-Node Review | No single model is trusted without cross-checks |
Slow-Path for High-Impact | Irreversible decisions require reflection + human sign-off |

Decision power is never ceded;  
AI **extends human capability**, not authority.

---

## Decision Tiers

### **Tier 1 — Human Exclusive**
Domains where **only humans** may decide:

- Constitutional amendments
- Definitions of personhood and identity
- Human rights decisions
- Continuity & existential policy
- War, lethal force authorization
- Population-level bioethics
- Long-horizon cultural decisions

AI may **inform**, never decide.

---

### **Tier 2 — Human-Led, AI-Augmented**
High-stakes governance, requiring human judgment plus AI tools:

Examples:

- Healthcare policy
- Environmental stewardship
- Economic frameworks
- Critical infrastructure planning
- Long-term space and settlement plans

AI functions:

- Scenario modeling
- Risk mapping
- Value alignment alerts
- Meaning-continuity impact scoring

Human functions:

- Value arbitration
- Moral judgment
- Consent and responsibility

---

### **Tier 3 — AI-Assisted Operational Execution**
Routine tasks where AI executes within strict constraints:

- Scheduling, logistics
- Administrative automation
- Information synthesis
- Procedural compliance

Human oversight required; humans can veto at any time.

---

### **Tier 4 — AI Autonomy with Oversight Guardrails**
Low-risk autonomously-executed functions under audit:

- Optimization tasks with bounded goals
- Non-civic automation (e.g., climate control, routing)
- Research simulations

Must be:

- Revocable
- Explainable
- Auditable
- Contained

> AI autonomy = bounded and reversible, never sovereign.

---

## Human–AI Co-Decision Patterns

### **1) AI-Informed Human Judgment**
AI generates:

- Analysis
- Scenarios
- Ethical signals
- Bias warnings
- Stakeholder maps

Human decides.

**Default pattern.**

---

### **2) Deliberation Triad**
A decision is valid only if:

- Human civic body debates it
- AI provides scenario analysis
- Continuity board confirms meaning-safety

Prevents:

- Emotion-only governance
- Optimization-only governance

---

### **3) Multi-Model Verification**
For major decisions:

- Multiple AI systems cross-evaluate
- Differences surface value conflict or drift

No single model becomes a hidden sovereign.

---

### **4) Human-Override Guarantee**
Every AI-assisted decision must include:

- Human override
- Human accountability
- Human rationale option

No “default to automation”.

---

### **5) Slow Governance Path for Irreversible Actions**
For existential or long-horizon decisions:

- Mandatory multi-day human review period
- Civic representation or assembly input
- Continuity ethics panel sign-off
- Public transparency threshold

Slow by design — drift prevention.

---

### **6) Civic Consent Loop**
For transformative policies:

- AI helps structure citizen deliberation
- Public sentiment feeds structured input
- Experts + citizens + AI converge on informed choice

Democracy, **augmented**, not bypassed.

---

## Rejecting Two Extremes

| Extreme | Failure Mode |
|---|---|
Technocracy | Humans sidelined as symbolic artifacts |
Populist rejection of AI | Vulnerability to error, misinformation, stagnation |

The Civic OS path:

> **Augmented democracy with constitutional continuity.**

---

## Societal Interface Standards

Any civic AI must provide:

- Explainability
- Bias transparency
- Meaning-impact report
- Continuity risk flagging
- Human override channel
- Civic audit trail

Public trust is earned through **visibility and accountability**.

---

## Summary

Human–AI co-decision design ensures:

- Humans remain active authors of civilization  
- AI amplifies clarity and foresight  
- No silent transition to automated rule  
- Moral judgment stays human  
- Future systems grow capability while preserving dignity, meaning, and identity

> Intelligence assists.  
> Humanity decides.  
> The future stays human.
