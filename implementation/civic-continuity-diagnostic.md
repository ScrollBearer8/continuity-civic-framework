# Civic Continuity Diagnostic

## Purpose

This diagnostic helps identify whether an organization or system is maintaining Civic Continuity — or silently degrading while appearing successful.

It is designed to be:
- Practical
- Observable
- Difficult to game

## Diagnostic Questions

### Authority & Trust

- Can people explain *why* current leaders hold authority?
- Is trust earned through competence and protection, or assumed through position?
- Are overrides documented, rare, and justified?

### Decision Placement

- Are high-uncertainty decisions made close to technical or situational reality?
- Or are they routinely escalated upward for approval without added signal?

### Responsibility Flow

- When decisions fail, is responsibility clear?
- Do decision-makers experience consequences proportional to their authority?
- Is failure used to refine judgment, or to assign blame?

### Signal Integrity

- Can dissent travel upward without punishment?
- Are inconvenient signals suppressed, delayed, or reframed for optics?
- Do leaders receive unfiltered information?

### Meaning Retention

- Can contributors articulate what the system exists to protect or advance?
- Has mission clarity degraded into slogans or metrics?
- Do people still care — or merely comply?

## Warning Indicators

A system is likely losing Civic Continuity if you observe:

- Increasing executive intervention without improved outcomes
- Rising approval-seeking behavior
- Decline in initiative from senior contributors
- Metrics improving while trust erodes
- High output paired with low legitimacy

## Interpretation

- Passing this diagnostic does not mean perfection.
- Failing it does not mean collapse is imminent.

But persistent failure indicates **structural decay masked by execution**.

Civic Continuity must be actively maintained.
It does not survive growth by default.
